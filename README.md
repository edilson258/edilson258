# A Low Level Guy

I am a Systems Engineer with a specialization in low-level design, ARMv8 assembly, Rust, and C lang. My expertise lies in crafting languages, implementing analyzers for language and binary formats, and optimizing code for performance and efficiency.

My recent endeavors include [RusVM](https://github.com/edilson258/rusvm), a Rust project meticulously crafted from scratch. `Rusvm` seamlessly parses Java class files, extracting vital information such as methods, flags, class attributes, constant pool layout, Java bytecode instruction decoding, and more.

## why low level?
You may wonder why I delve into the realm of low-level intricacies. In essence, my affinity stems from a relentless pursuit of challenges. Despite numerous attempts, crafting a polished UI remains elusive. In a landscape dominated by web developers, I seek differentiation and thrive on pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

## And...
I believe my projects serve as a testament to my capabilities and dedication. I trust you'll find them both impressive and compelling.
