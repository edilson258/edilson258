# System Engineer

Low-level systems engineer specialized in language design, ARMv8 assembly, Rust, and C lang. Experienced in implementing parsers for both language and binary formats. Passionate about optimizing code for performance and efficiency.

My Recent works include `Rusvm` which is a project written entirely from scratch in Rust that parses a Java Class File and extract all relevant information such as methods, class flags and attributes, constant pool layout, unpacking java `byte code` instructions and more.

## Why Low Level Stuff?

The short answer is: I can't build a decent UI, doesn't matter how many times i try (believe me, i tried a lot). Nowadays there lots of web devs and i wanted to do something different.

## And...
I think my project will speak for myself. I hope you will enjoy it!
